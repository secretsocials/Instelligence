# Instagram Analytics Dashboard (Streamlit)

This repo is now updated to include **openpyxl** in `requirements.txt`, so `.xlsx` files work without extra steps.

## Quick Start

```bash
# clone repo, then:
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

Upload your Excel export (.xlsx) and click ▶️ Run Analysis.
